# Some of My Concerns About the World

*22 December, 2025*

I am going to write some of my concerns here. It is a bit like a word in Chinese internet called **“jianzheng (键政)”**, which means discussing politics through typing on the keyboard.

## Career

My top concern is meant for career. Under this recessionary circumstance, no one can guarantee they will find a satisfactory job. Even worse, they might not be able to find work at all.

Although I often comfort myself by saying that:

> “I am a student of C9 universities; if I fail to find a job, there will be few people who can find work.”

I am really nervous about my future. Even if I find a job successfully, I cannot be sure whether it can make ends meet or afford my costly lifestyle.My ideal lifestyle includes traveling around the world, working in big cities, and owning valuable properties.However, it feels like an ethereal dream.

How to dissolve my concerns? Just struggle studying and working, I think. I don’t know whether it can work, but it is the best way I can think of.

## Studies

As I wrote in my first post, I have encountered many problems in my studies.

I almost messed up my studies in these six months. I I focused on Japanese idols and travel, rather than studying, which resulted in me barely passing grades in almost every subject. Looking back to my Augest, when I just stepped into the university, I vowed that I would study hard and struggle to be recommended for postgraduate studies. Although our subject has a relatively high rate of students being recommended for postgraduate studies, around 40% , I cannot even get into top 40%. My courses like SICP, linear algebra, calculus and so on, had kept me extremely busy -- but if I didn't addict to Japanese idols, I probably would have plenty of time to study.

It seems like that as long as I focus on study instead of Japanese idols, my academic performance will improve. However, I need to question myself -- am I really have the ability to improve my academic performance?
