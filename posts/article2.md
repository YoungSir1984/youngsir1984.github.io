# Article 2 – Some of My Concerns About the World

*22 December, 2025*

I am going to write some of my concerns here. It is a bit like a word in Chinese internet called **“jianzheng (键政)”**, which means discussing politics through typing on the keyboard.

## Career

My top concern is meant for career. Under this recessionary circumstance, no one can guarantee they will find a satisfactory job. Even worse, they might not be able to find work at all.

Although I often comfort myself by saying that:

> “I am a student of C9 universities; if I fail to find a job, there will be few people who can find work.”

I am really nervous about my future. Even if I find a job successfully, I cannot be sure whether it can make ends meet or afford my costly lifestyle.

My ideal lifestyle includes:
- traveling around the world
- working in big cities
- owning valuable properties

However, it feels like an ethereal dream.

How to dissolve my concerns? Just struggle studying and working, I think. I don’t know whether it can work, but it is the best way I can think of.

## Studies

As I wrote in my first post, I have encountered many problems in my studies.
